# Grocr
As a submission for HackZurich 2016 we built an app where you can crowd source grocery shopping.
Think of a Grandmother who has got problem with her knees. For her going grocery shopping can be a big problem. 
Or two guys who want to watch a Football game but not have any beer, so they open up Grocr and order it there.

Here are some Screenshots, keep in mind though that it was a Hackathon project so don't expect anything fancy:
